# Logical Operators Exercise

Write a Java program using the given code template in the `Greetings` class. Your program should accomplish the following tasks:

1. Declare a boolean variable named `isHuman` and assign it the value `true`.

2. Implement an `if` statement to check if `isHuman` is equal to `false`.
    - If the condition evaluates to `true`, display the messages:
      - "It is not a human!"
      - "And I am scared of aliens"
    - Each message should be on a separate line.

3. Declare an integer variable named `highestScore` and assign it the value `90`.

4. Implement an `if` statement to check if `highestScore` is less than `100`.
    - If the condition evaluates to `true`, print the message "You got the high score!" to the console.

5. Declare another integer variable named `runnerUpScore` and assign it the value `85`.

6. Implement an `if` statement to check if `highestScore` is greater than `runnerUpScore` and also less than `100`.
    - If the condition evaluates to `true`, display the message "Greater than the runner-up score and less than 100" on the console.
