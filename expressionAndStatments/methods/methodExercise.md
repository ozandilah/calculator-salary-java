# Return Statement in a Method - Exercise 01

## Problem Statement
Write a Java program that simulates a leaderboard for a game. The program should include a class named MyMethods with the following specifications:

The program should have a main method where the leaderboard positions are calculated and displayed for different players.

Implement a method named calculatePosition that takes an integer parameter playerScore and returns an integer representing the player's position on the leaderboard. The positions are determined based on the following criteria:

If the player's score is equal to or greater than 1000, their position is 1.

If the player's score is between 500 (inclusive) and 1000 (exclusive), their position is 2.

If the player's score is between 100 (inclusive) and 500 (exclusive), their position is 3.

If the player's score is between 50 (inclusive) and 100 (exclusive), their position is 4.

Otherwise, their position is 5.

Implement a method named displayPosition that takes two parameters: a string playerName representing the player's name, and an integer position representing the player's position on the leaderboard.
